This website was built  to automate the maunaul ticket booking system in our college(IIITDM Kancheepuram) fests
The website covers the complete ticket booking system , starting with showing the offers ,taking student details , and calcuating the amount as per the discount applicable and the main payment gateway
It offers paymnet options such as netbanking, card, upi etc.
Currently upi option is inactive as the complete kyc is required of the recieving bank account which was not done as the website was in development mode , which can be easily turned active during the actual booking time during fest
It also has the feature of mailing the tickets (through automated mailing) to the user email id once the booking is done successfully
The backend is developed in nodejs and for the database MongoDB was used, for the frontend javascript , bootstrap , html ,ejs were used
